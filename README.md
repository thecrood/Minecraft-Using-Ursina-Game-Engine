Minecraft is a Voxel Based Game.
Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 200 million copies sold and over 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.

In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

Here i use Blender to create objects
Here i use Python Programming Language
Here i use Ursina Game Engine

Note : it is not a full minecraft game, it is just the replica of that game and it is just for education purpose only. in this Project when we run the code a square surface apprears on which you can put voxels on each other using left mouse button(voxels type can be changed using 1,2,3,4) 
. You can also make voxels disappear with right click of mouse. this is not like minecraft but gives preety much idea of minecraft.

#Ursina Game Engine
Powered by Python

    Ursina makes it easier to develop games, visualizations and other kinds of software.
    The concise API combined with the power of the Python programming language,
    makes life easier for the developer so they can focus on what they are making.

    Things you won't miss from other game engines:

        • Waiting for your code to compile
        • The editor crashing and possibly losing your work
        • Not being able to fix engine bugs or add features
        • Overly verbose code
        • Uncustomizable workflow
        • Waiting for imports
        • Long build times
        • Revenue cut or subscription fee

Useful Features

        • Reload code/textures/models while in-game
        • Automatic import of .psd and .blend files
        • Play in fullscreen while developing
        • Easy to use mesh class for making procedural geometry
        • Lots of included procedural 3D primitives
        
Platforms

        • Windows
        • Linux
